Hearn\", 162833) #name, mathid\r\n```\r\nThis generates:\r\n![Graph](http://i.imgur.com/G9UtDYv.jpg)\r\nas well as a pdf version.\r\n\r\nMethod `graph_combined_genealogy(name_mathid_pairs)` from `build_genealogy.py` builds a math genealogy graph for a list\r\nof individuals, then generates their combined genealogy graph.\r\nInput argument is a list of indiviudal's name-id number pairs.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\ngraph_combined_genealogy([[\"Tristan A. Hearn\", 162833],\r\n                          [\"Terry Tao\", 43967],\r\n                          [\"David Alber\", 110487]])\r\n```\r\nThis generates:\r\n![Graph](http://i.imgur.com/zelQDx9.jpg)\r\nas well as a pdf version.\r\n\r\n##TODO:\r\n\r\n- Methods that will graph just the minimum path between groups individuals, by finding their most recent common grand-advisor\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
